    <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
    <p>
        All work you submit must be your own, and your work must not be submitted by someone else. Plagiarism is considered academic fraud and is taken very seriously. The department uses software to compare programs for evidence of similar code. Please review the 
        <a href="https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">Rules and Regulations from the U of T Governing Council</a>, especially the <strong>Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please also see the <a href="https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/academic-advising-and-support/student-academic-integrity" target="_blank">Office of Student Academic Integrity</a> for more details.
    </p>
    <p><strong>We want you to succeed and are here to help. Please don't copy.</strong></p>
    
    <h3>How to Avoid Plagiarism:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Never look at another student’s assignment solution (except for teammates, if collaboration is allowed). This includes solutions on paper, computer screens, or any other medium.</li>
        <li>Never show your assignment solution to another student. This rule applies to all stages of your work, including drafts and incomplete solutions.</li>
        <li>If you find code online that solves part or all of an assignment, do not use or submit any part of it. Many academic offences involve students who unknowingly use the same online source.</li>
        <li>Be cautious with "tutoring services." Some services encourage academic misconduct, leading to university suspensions. If unsure, ask your instructor—we are here to help.</li>
    </ul>
